	/*
   - There is a preset class in java called "EXCEPTION". It's similar to scanner.
	 In order to add an exception we must define one.
	 Example:
	 			Eagle
	 			  |
	 			Eaglet
	 			
	 			Deer
	 			  |
	 			Fawn
	 Every excception we write it will always be a "baby" to the parent class "EXCEPTION"
	 			EXCEPTION
	 			    |
	 		 Exception Case 1
	 This is proven by the Java language basic Inheritance. This means that every child class will retain features of the parent class.
   * Example:
	 Line Calculator
	 5 + 9 = 9, * 2 = 18.
	 18 / 2 = 9, / 0 = ERROR
	 DivisonByZero Exception will stop the program from running the "/ 0" process and skip it. It will then continue on with the rest of the process.
	 
   * 9 & 4 = ERROR
	 This is caused by "&" not being an acceptable operation. We create the UnknownOperator Exception class to fix this.
