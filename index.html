            This is an affinity diagram used to describe 5 main clusters: Goals, Potential Problems, Costs, Useful Tools/Ideas, and Details. The goal of this diagram was to brainstorm several ideas that could fit into these clusters together
            to get a better approach to a solution to our problem of, "Too many people use the USC gym at once".

          <p>
            In my storyboard, Chad wakes up and wants to go to the gym. He decides that he's going to test the app he and his group have created. Checking the app, he sees that the gym doesn't have a lot of people currently
            checked in. So he makes his way to the gym, scans his ID, and re-checks the app. He sees that it increases the population meaning that the app is properly working. He then proceeds to get the gains.
