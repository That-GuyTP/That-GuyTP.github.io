          <p>
            This is an affinity diagram used to describe 5 main clusters: Goals, Potential Problems, Costs, Useful Tools/Ideas, and Details. The goal of this diagram was to brainstorm several ideas that could fit into these clusters together
            to get a better approach to a solution to our problem of, "Too many people use the USC gym at once".

          <p>
            In my storyboard, Chad wakes up and wants to go to the gym. He decides that he's going to test the app he and his group have created. Checking the app, he sees that the gym doesn't have a lot of people currently
            checked in. So he makes his way to the gym, scans his ID, and re-checks the app. He sees that it increases the population meaning that the app is properly working. He then proceeds to get the gains.

          <p>
            Here is a draw-up of a demo for the app. The app would include a default home page with several other tabs the user could look at. A "status" page detailing the current gym population of Strom Thurmond, a "trend" page that depicts a chart showing the usual business throughout the day, a "schedule" page to allow users to schedule workouts or training sessions, and "settings"/"account" pages for miscellaneous add-ons.
