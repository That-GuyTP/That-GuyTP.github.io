            <p> I'm Thomas Peterson. A senior at USC majoring in CIS. In December 2022 I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy Type II. My daytime sleep test showed that I entered REM 2/5 times I took a nap
                meaning I was legally a narcoleptic. I would later develop Narcolepsy Type I with mild cataplexy. Since then I've been trying to find the best ways to relieve Narcolepsy symptoms and 
                finding others who also have it.

            <h2>Website Purpose</h2>
            <p> During my CSCE 242 class we were assigned a main website project
                which I took as the chance to set up a Narcolepsy website that people could use to find out more information. I noticed that most narcolepsy websites are very bland or strictly informal
                which takes away from someone's desire to learn about narcolepsy. My goal is to create a website that is both interesting to look at and informal. I want people to take away as much as they
                can from the website when they view it.
