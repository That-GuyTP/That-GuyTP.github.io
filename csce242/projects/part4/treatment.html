            <h2>Treatment</h2>
            <p>Sadly Narcolepsy does not currently have a cure. While it can be treated, it is a life long condition and will take a lot of patience and time
                to learn how to manage life with. The best recommendation is to visit a trusted Sleep Doctor to assist with providing medical solutions. 
                With narcolepsy still being a less researched disorder there isn't any specific medicine that is used to help treat the symptoms. 
            </p>
            <p>I want to reiterate that isn't medical advice but merely what I've seen and heard myself and others use. For those with cataplexy there are medications like Venlafaxine 
                which is used to help prevent cataplexy attacks. Otherwise the two common approaches are either using medication to help keep you awake or help put you to sleep. Common medications
                used for awake are Lisdexafetamine, Dextroamphetamine, Methylphenidate, & Modafinil. For sleeping solutions the most used are Melatonin, Xywav, and Xyrem.

                    <li><b>Maintain a Regular Sleep Schedule</b> - The best thing someone who suffers from narcolepsy can do is maintain a regular sleep schedule as best they can. Go to sleep at the same time and wake up at the same time. This can help reduce daytime sleepiness and control one's sleep cycle.</li>

                    <li><b>Eat Healthy and Stay in Shape</b> - Eating proper meals and staying physically healthly both contribute to feeling better overall for an individual. By sticking to a healthier diet, you reduce the chance of these factoring in to worsening sleep. For some narcoleptics, eating big meals can cause them to become drowsy so it's recommended to eat more, smaller meals than fewer, bigger ones.</li>

                    <li><b>Take Naps</b> - For some people, taking a quick power nap everyday helps keep their sleep cycle in check. My recommendation would to either choose a 20 minute nap or an 1 1/2 hour nap. These times have been the best recorded durations for naps.</li>
