            <p> I'm Thomas Peterson. A senior at USC majoring in CIS. In December 2022 i was diagnosed with Narcolepsy Type II. I would later develop Narcolepsy Type I with mild cataplexy.
                Since then I've been trying to find the best ways to relieve Narcolepsy symptoms and finding others who also have it.
