            <p> I'm Thomas Peterson. A senior at USC majoring in CIS. In December 2022 i was diagnosed with Narcolepsy Type II. I would later develop Narcolepsy Type I with mild cataplexy.
                Since then I've been trying to find the best ways to relieve Narcolepsy symptoms and finding others who also have it. During my CSCE 242 class we were assigned a main website project
                which I took as the chance to set up a Narcolepsy website that people could use to find out more information. I noticed that most narcolepsy websites are very bland or strictly informal
                which takes away from someone's desire to learn about narcolepsy.
