        <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
        <p>Molly is a golden retriever that's my Mom and Stepdad's dog. She's 4 years old and will be 5 on September 24th. She's a very kind and sweet dog but was raised during Covid-19 <br>
           and has some social anxiety as a result. She loves meeting new people and constiently wants attention. Some of her favorite things to do are retrieve (steal) items, <br>
           play tug-of-war, chase after cars, bark at walkers, and fight lizards/geese. Click <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/">here</a> for more info about Golden Retrievers.

        <h2>Strange Things About Molly</h2>
        <p>
            Molly is definitely an interesting dog. Unlike most golden retrievers, Molly hates water. She doesn't like swimming, playing in, or taking a bath. <br>
            Molly also doesn't like affection between family members for some reason. If I or someone else goes to give another family member a hug she comes to get inbetween <br>
            the interaction. Molly also has "moods" where she just goes and lays down somewhere random even if the family is together and hanging out. During this "mood" she will <br>
            almost always ignore any remarks trying to get her to join the group.
