            <h2>"Isn't narcolepsy when you sleep all the time?"</h2>
            <p>
                Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects an individual's ability to control their sleep cycle. Oftentimes these individuals can fall asleep at random depending on their situation. This is called cataplexy. While many narcoleptics have cataplexy, some don't have it at all or only have a minor form of it.
                This is the difference between being a type I Narcoleptic (having cataplexy) or a type II Narcoleptic (without cataplexy). Narcolepsy also can involve many other symptoms like sleep paralysis, hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations, drastic changes in REM sleep, and insomnia.

            <h2>What's the Science Behind Narcolepsy?</h2>
            <p>
                Hypocretin is a chemical in your brain that helps control being awake and get you into REM sleep. People with narcolepsy cannot properly maintain this chemical. For a normal person their sleep cycle is a standard fall and rise. They fall asleep, progressivly enter into deep sleep, rise from it, and then wake up. For narcoleptics it's more like a roler coaster.
